History,Antebelluvian ,Creation Myths,"""This book collects a variety of creation myths

'Vektron, the Stars, Oqular, the Sun and Scriveen, the Moon, looked down from the sky and created the world below
Oqular, the eye of truth, created the shining Metallic Dragons and the Sun Elves in their great cities
Scriveen, the wolfâ€™s howl, created the wild Chromatic Dragons and the Moon Elves in their nomadic tribes
Vektron, the hand that guides the stars, saw that this was good, and set the turning wheels of fate into motion'""",
History,Antebelluvian ,Stars And Gems: The Myths,"""This book deals with the mystery of Star Elves and Gem Dragons

'It is well known that triads are powerful - there are three sets of three Deities and this pattern extends throughout the world. So why then, are there only two kinds of elves, and two kinds of dragons? Oqular created the Metallic Dragons and the Sun Elves. Scriveen created the Chromatic Dragons and the Moon Elves. There are various myths and legends of beings created by the third Deity of the Sky Above - Children of Vektron, Gem Dragons, with scales like shining crystals, and Star Elves, with skin like the night sky and hair shining with starlight'
The book goes on to collect a variety of these myths but ends with the conclusion that Vektron is too perfect to create something that would then disappear into legend - so Vektron must have been too far above to create living creatures""",

Scriveen created Cloud Giants to burst the Rains
Oqular created Storm Giants to howl the Winds'

History,Antebelluvian ,Gods of the World Below,"""A series of books and scrolls detailing the creation of the Worldly Gods - after the Elvenfall the Deities of the Sky realised that the World Below was not suitable for mortals and would need to be changed

'Oqular created Falstriss, Goddess of Invention, Mother of the Humans and Dwarves. She would teach mortals how to progress and strive.
Scriveen created Heonn, God of Family, Father of the Halflings and Treefolk. He would teach mortals how to live together and farm the land.
Vektron created Arkvile, Goddess of Death, Mother of the Orcs and Goblins. She would leave the mortal realm, and shepherd the mortal souls once their time had come'

'And so the gates to the underworld were flung open and Arkvile's servants were unleashed. Legions of marauding demons and hordes of savage undead set upon the mortal plane. 
The world below was unprepared, and gentle Heonn was captured as his farms burned
With a heavy heart, Falstriss approached her Forge

With tears dripping onto the hot metals
Falstriss invented War'

The Hangman's Hand wielded by Zulgrush the unrelenting, who raised vast armies of undead

History,Antebelluvian ,End of the First War,"""Despite the great heroism of the mortals led by Falstriss, the war seemed unwinnable
Every mortal that fell became a new undead soldier in the armies of Arkvile
The deities of the Sky Above had refused to intervene

So the Demigods sought a new path to victory
Driselle the Shadow Thief infiltrated the Star Vaults of Vektron and stole the secrets within
She took these to Maween the Scholar, who studied the secrets of the Stars
And crafted from them a new power, a power that mortals could wield

This was the dawn of Arcane magic
Maween created the Council of the Nine Mages to control this power
And Jaharas the Pirate Lord sailed a great fleet on the winds of the Elemental Storm they created
This overwhelming force was enough to destroy the Undead Legions and force the Demons back to the Underworld""",
History,Antebelluvian ,Creation of the Eight Heavens and the Nine Hells,"""After Arkviles forces were defeated in the First War, the gods knew that if she was left as the only keeper of mortal souls which had passed, she would eventually have enough to create a new army of the undead. Each of the gods and demigods created their own afterlife, and after death each mortal soul is judged and sent to the appropriate one. Only a mortal soul which has failed to please the 8 other gods would go to the underworld.
But given enough time even these souls would amount to an army. So the gods (or according to a minority of the documents here, just Vektron) created the nine hells and the infernal legions of the Devils. The devils would fight Arkviles demons for every soul that landed in the underworld in the unending Blood War. The gods knew that devils must be as evil and ferocious as the demons to fight them, and so gave them a weakness to star-metal (silver) so they could be defeated by mortals.
None of the books or documents in this section go into more details on the nine hells, other than to give various warnings of the dangers of Devil kind

He found the Lost Tomb of the Giants, where they had slumbered ever since the Deities of the Sky Above used them to create the World Below
Stealing through their ancient halls, he climbed the throne of the Storm Giant King
And stole his belt knife - in Leonhir's hands this was a mighty greatsword

Stealthily leaving the underground citadel, Leonhir noticed a still reflecting pool
And could not resist admiring his reflection as he swung his new sword
Great bolts of lightning fired from the blade, and thunder shook the cavern
Leonhir fled with his blade, but the Giants had been awoken'

There is a dusty collection of journals written by a moon elf Druid named Faheelwild that mention intense dreams from Scriveen

The Feywild, with its wild forests and dazzling cities, home to wild Winter Court and the refined Summer Court of the Fae
And the Shadowfell, a dark twisted landscape of monstrous nightmare creatures'
The book features many supposed accounts of journeys to the other two realms, and ends with a startling conclusion
'The two most impactful events in history were the Elvenfall and the First War. I believe these events created the other two planes
The Feywild is our world if the Elvenfall never happened - the Summer and Winter Courts are the immortal Sun and Moon elves

One day, there was a great storm
But the ferry ran as always - there were messages to deliver

Restricted,Occult,A journey through the Nine Hells by Abernath Vanquess,"""This ancient book, bound in a strange leather, claims to be an account of a mortal that somehow travelled the nine hells and returned to tell the tale. The book makes it explicit that Vektron created the Devils and the Hells, and goes into detail about their complex and byzantine political structure, as well as their many organised but depraved tortures of each other and the mortal souls in their grasp. Abernath is treated as a guest of the Archdevils in command of each layer of the hells, though why he is granted this privilege is never explained. The book ends with a sobering reflection that, if it were not for their distraction by the  endless Blood War with the Demons of the Abyss, the Devils would be a terrible force as they schemed to take all the souls of the mortal world. There are various notes in the book written in a strange script.

The infernal hierarchy is complex and difficult to parse. The lemures and imps are the lowest, and the Archdevil Lords such as Hyveranox the greatest, but in between there is an almost incomprehensible web of ranks. Devils can be promoted to greater power by obtaining more souls or demoted as punishment. Devilkind, as a direct creation of Vektron, is unable to utter falsehoods or break any promises. Any deals with them are ironclad, but will also be filled with complicated small print and side clauses attempting to trip up mortals

Restricted,Occult,Demonology,"""A dark black tome. An attempted taxonomy of Demonkind, from tiny Quasits to terrible Balors, though the authors note that the Demon hordes of the Abyss are so chaotic and ever changing as to be difficult to classify. The only constant among the terrifying fiends described within is their mad destructive instinct and desire to burn and destroy mortals. There are some notes on the Demon forces of the First War, including more detailed descriptions of the Demon generals and their Tridavar weapons:

- Weapon of Zulgrush the unrelenting: The Hangman's Hand (true name unknown) is described as a long staff with a skeletal, many fingered hand at it's end. It helped raise vast numbers of Undead. The demons were genetally chaotic in their battle strategy, willing to sacrifice large numbers of their own troops. It was Zulgrush who allowed for this strategy by creating new armies

- Weapon of Krazyth the mutilator: The Soul Cage (true name unknown) is described as a suit of white armour. It helped its wearer create strange Undead abominations from the souls of mortals. It was these creatures that were able to stand toe to toe with Dragons and Demigods fighting for Falstriss.

- Weapon of Buulplox the soul eater: The Bone Maw (true name unknown) is described as a great scythe. It's abilites are unclear, though it's wielder was a fearsome fighter.

The section raises several questions the authors could not answer:
Falstriss is the Goddess of Invention. Yet it seems wielders of her creations, the Osilla Arms, were often defeated in combat by wielders of the Tridavar. How was Arkvile able to craft weapons more powerful than the Goddess of crafting?
The records only ever mention Demons wielding the Tridavar - did Arkvile ever march into battle with weapons of her own?
Finally, there are legends that the Tridavar brought together would have unmatched power - so why do the records and legends of the First War never mention the Demon's doing so? Were they simply too chaotic to cooperate?""",Yes
